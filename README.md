> **Galway Libraries Database**

This repository contains a project that simulates the database of all the libraries in Galway. The goal of this project is to model the library system in Galway, including information about the libraries, books, members, and transactions.

> Repository Structure
The repository consists of three main files:

**ERD**: This file contains the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the database. The ERD visually represents the structure of the database, including entities, relationships, and key attributes.

**Mermaid.md**: This file contains the Mermaid script that generates the ERD. Mermaid is a tool that allows for the creation of diagrams using markdown-like syntax, making it easy to maintain and update the ERD as the database design evolves.

**SQL-script.sql**: This file contains the SQL script to create the database. The script includes the necessary SQL commands to create the tables, relationships, and constraints as per the design specified in the ERD.

> Getting Started
To use or modify this database, follow these steps:

Review the ERD: Start by examining the ERD.pdf to understand the database structure, including the entities involved and how they relate to each other.

Modify the Mermaid Script (Optional): If you need to make changes to the ERD, you can modify the Mermaid.md file. Once modified, you can regenerate the ERD diagram using a Mermaid-compatible tool.

Create the Database: Use the SQL-script.sql to create the database. You can run this script in your SQL environment to set up the database structure as designed.

> Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this project, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes. Contributions that improve the database design, optimize the SQL script, or enhance the ERD are welcome.
